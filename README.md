# HimmelWacht

This repository contains all the files, documentation, and source code for the HimmelWacht project. The project integrates a Raspberry Pi for high-level processing, an ESP32 for real-time hardware control, and a laboratory computer for AI model inference.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

```
.
├── cad/                 # CAD files (FreeCAD, STL) for 3D-printed components.
├── documents/           # Project documentation, datasheets, and diagrams.
├── esp/                 # ESP32 firmware and related tools.
├── laboratory_computer/ # AI models, training scripts, and inference code.
├── raspberry/           # Software for the Raspberry Pi.
└── util/                # Miscellaneous utilities, screenshots, and test files.
```

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with more detailed information about its contents and setup instructions.
