## Tooling 

For labeling and image annotation we used [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) which provides a free & open-source Solution for data annotation in various types. For the first training runs (Run 1 to Run 4) we used rectangle anotation to ensure the least amount of processing is needed when inferencing the models.
