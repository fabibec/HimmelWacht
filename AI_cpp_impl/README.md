*This contains the source code for running the AI inference via ONNX-Runtime, CUDA, and OPENCV compiled with GSTREAMER*

The code is completely unused in this project due to very very poor results and enormous setup requirements. 

DLL's, binaries and other external necessary utilities are are not included due to size limitations (>300 MB for ONNX).

For the sake of completion it is still left in the project.
