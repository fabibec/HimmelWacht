*This contains the source code for running the AI inference via ONNX-Runtime, CUDA, cuDNN, and OPENCV compiled with GSTREAMER*

The code is completely unused in this project due to very poor results, enormous setup requirements and high complexity - the required time to understand ONNX-format would have been enormous without assurance that the goal of running the inference on the RPI5 would work properly (e.g. due to hardware limitations).

DLL's, binaries and other external necessity, utilities are not included due to size limitations (>300 MB for ONNX).
