# models

Every directory contains the last- and best weights of the AI-model. The old model was exported to ONNX but is deprecated since retraining with image augmentation of new models was done. 

The directories with the NEW-suffix are the latest trained models and contain various data and results about the training process and the weights and should be used for inference due to more robust performance.
